# UOMRotobicsTeam4RobotDesign

This project is developed collaboratively by Team 4 of the 2024 Robotics program at the University of Manchester, focused on developing a robot based on Leo Rover and ROS2 capable of autonomously retrieving coloured objects and placing them in corresponding storage bins. The system is modular, supporting navigation, perception, manipulation, and control functionalities.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Detects coloured objects in the environment.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Plans paths and avoids obstacles using ROS2 Navigation.
- **Precise Manipulation**: Controls the robotic arm and gripper to pick and place objects.
- **Simulation**: Tests algorithms in Gazebo and visualizes in RViz.

## Requirements
- ROS2 Humble
- Leo Rover SDK
